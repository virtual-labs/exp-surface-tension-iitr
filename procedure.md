Follow these steps to determine the Removal of Hardness of Water by Ion Exchange Column

- Clean the stalagmometer with chromic acid and then wash with water. Note the room temperature.  
- Suck the liquid above the upper mark on the stalagmometer and adjust the flow with a pinch cork so that 10–15 drops fall per minute, and set it vertically to the clamp.  
- Release the liquid and

  (i) Start counting the drops from upper mark of the stalagmometer till the lower meniscus of the liquid touches the lower end, or  
  (ii) Collect 10 drops of liquid in dry and pre-weight pycnometer and measure the weight of the liquid.  
- Repeat the experiment for the unknown liquid and for concordant readings.  

#### **Safety Precautions**

1.The stalagmometer should be strictly vertical in all observations.  
2.The temperature should be constant throughout the experiment.  
3.The formation of drops should not be too fast or too slow.
